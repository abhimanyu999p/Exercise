This is a collection of my day-to-day learning activities . A very few things are complete so far though.

1. A minimalistic gpio kernel driver, myGpio, for raspberry pi 3
- Provides open(),close() and ioctl() system calls.
- Resides in kernel-DD/myGpio/
 
2. An uart based xLoader terminal application for flashig bare-metal raspberry pi
- Employs a slightly different version of xloader protocol to transmit binary files to raspberry pi for flashing.
- Resides in utilities/xmodem/

3. A GUI version of xLoader using Qt framework
- A cute little GUI application.
- Resides in Qt/xLoader/

4. An uart bootloader for raspberry pi
- Bare-metal program to receive binary files over uart for flashing.
- Resides in pi/bare-metal/uart-bootloader/

5. A simple utility program, bin2hex, to display binary files.
- Displays hexdump on terminal but in a slightly different way than how 'hexdump' does! 
- Resides in utilities/bin2hex/

More to come ...
